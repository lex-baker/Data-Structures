# Problem 7

Most of this problem was a repeat from Problem 5, but a bit more challenging since now I was working through the Router wrapper. I enjoyed this problem quite a bit, because it reminded me of the week straight that I had spent configuring a local Nginx server. That definitely helped me understand what was going on here, as a path is just the names of folders you walk through on your way to the file to be served.
