# Problem 5

All work was done both on the online Jupyter Notebook as well as the included Trie.ipynb file. 

I created a second recursive function "helper" because I was struggling to get the all_suffixes variable to not become [[[['suffix']]]], and while a more elegant solution may exist, my code works in an understandable way with minimal workarounds.
